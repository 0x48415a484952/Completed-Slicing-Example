# Completed-Slicing-Example

This was a university project to learn how to use Frama-C for slicing and creating CFG and PDG 
The Main Source Code of The C Program Is Written By "MIKE LAMAN" and it has been modified very little by "HAZHIR AHMADZADEH" 
The Default Source code could have not been opened in Frama-C so i had to tweak it a little bit.
this piece of code was ofuscated and will run you in circles :) just use it like so: 
./hazhir 16
./hazhir 200
